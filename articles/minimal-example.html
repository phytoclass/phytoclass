</h2>
<p>To run phytoclass you must prepare a sample matrix (aka the
<code>S matrix</code>). For this we recommend creating a
comma-separated-value (<code>.csv</code>) file. Several example files
are included in the <a href="https://github.com/phytoclass/phytoclass/tree/main/vignettes" class="external-link"><code>./vignettes/</code>
directory of the phytoclass source code</a>. <code>.csv</code> files can
be created in any plain text editor. Below is an example S-matrix
<code>.csv</code> file content:</p>

<p>This example includes only 14 samples (rows), with the pigment
concentration of each sample included on each row. 14 is the minumum
number of rows required to apply simulated annealing. The first row
includes the names for each pigment. These <strong>pigment abbreviations
must match exactly</strong> to the pigments in the F-matrix. For this
example we are using the default <code>phytoclass:Fm</code> F matrix,
and the column names in the example above should be used.</p>

<p>NOTE: Instead of using a plain text editor, <code>.csv</code> files
can also be created using a spreadsheet editor (MS Excel, Google Docs,
LibreOffice Calc, etc.) by using “save as” or “export” to
<code>.csv</code>.</p>
